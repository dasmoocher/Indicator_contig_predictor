# De novo metagenomic marker pipeline

## Roadmap
1. Find data (2 environments, 3+ to test)
  * Human gut microbiome
  * Human skin, mouse gut?
2. BLAST script (one line)
  * SRA Blast - no paper on it, but Ben has some webinars
3. Coverage generator
  * What format do you want the BLAST outputs to be in?
4. Gen. Classifier 
  * Feature selection (may eventually need to do this on subsets - some kind of string-based approach?) 
5. Probability of gene co-occurrence
